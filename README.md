# RummySeniorProject

These files describe the expected times until Rummy for every hand of the not-real games of 3-card and 4-card rummy assuming replacement.

Also included are the files required to generate these values (written in C++) and the files used to create graphs of them (in Python).

Any compilation for 3 or 4 card Rummy will require the hand.o object file, plus hand.h in the same directory.
